Conducted comprehensive data exploration and understanding of COVID-19 dataset using Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
Imported and loaded the dataset using pandas, gaining insights into its structure and contents.
Employed various methods to understand the dataset, including checking basic information, data shape, and identifying missing values.
Preprocessed the data by dropping irrelevant columns, converting data types, and handling missing values.
Transformed categorical variables into boolean values for analysis using custom functions.
Utilized visualization techniques such as pie charts, line plots, histograms, and bar plots to visualize different aspects of the dataset and gain insights.
Analyzed the distribution of COVID-19 positive cases over time and by gender to identify trends and patterns.
Investigated the relationship between COVID-19 test results and symptoms, analyzing symptom counts among positive cases.
Implemented machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for COVID-19 prediction.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.
Created pipelines to preprocess categorical features and train machine learning models efficiently.
Evaluated the performance of each model using validation accuracy and selected the best-performing model for testing.
Tested the best model on the test set and reported the test accuracy for COVID-19 prediction.
